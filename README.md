Portfolio of CS Work

CS2 Labs - contains most work from AP Computer Science A (2019-2020).

CS3 Labs - contains most work from Computer Science 3 (2020-2021).

Personal Projects - contains out-of-school coding projects, primarily done for practice or for to aid in various tedious, menial tasks. As it was written before I implemented version control, Basic Derivative Calculator no longer works.

CS Competition Work - contains programs written during some official competitions 2019-2020. The programs were created on a personal laptop, and the only ones saved are those that were fully completed (not those only partially completed and abondoned to prioritize others). Many competitions did not allow for programs to be saved after they finished.

CSUIL-Practice - contains programs written as practice for CSUIL competitions.

Coursera Courses - contains coursework from computer science coursera courses that I have taken.
